    <h1 id="about-me">about me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a guy that likes fast things, things that fly, and things that
      shouldn&#39;t work but do anyway. I love making ideas come to life. I am a
      fourth-year aerospace engineering student at Texas A&amp;M University, and
      I&#39;m graduating in May of 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any leads on jobs that let me spend a ridiculous amount of
      time building really cool stuff with great people, and makes me enough
      money to eat and work on my old motorcycle, give me a call.
