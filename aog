                <ul>
                    <li>Contributed to the design of A&M's first regeneratively cooled rocket engine.</li>
                    <li>Undertook structural analysis for Ragnarök's thrust chamber assembly, deriving load-cases using fluid-flow fundamentals, simulating them using Ansys Static Structural Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and verifying their validity using structural theory. </li>
                    <li>Recommended geometry changes based on FEA results, and executed them in Onshape.</li>
